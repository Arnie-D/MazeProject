Maze for Android

The program of this maze is written in Java, produced from direct code-
writing and not xml-design. Produced using Android Studio. Works on the latest update of Android.

The design of the maze is in spaces, there being 19x19 spaces on the board,
each deligated in the program as point values whose x and y values are
multiples of 20.
The player moves between spaces, if the character hits a wall space, then it is
reset to its original location.
Secret passage at x = 220 (8 spaces to the right of the character's original
location)
