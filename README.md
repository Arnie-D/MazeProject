# MazeProject
Maze for Android

The Maze Project here is written in Java, produced mostly from direct code-
writing and not xml-design.
The design of the whole thing is space-based, there 19x19 spaces on the board,
each deligated in the program as point values that are whose x and y values are
multiples of 20.
The player moves between spaces, if the character hits a wall space, then it is
reset to its original location.
Secret passage at x = 220 (8 spaces to the write of the character's original
location)
